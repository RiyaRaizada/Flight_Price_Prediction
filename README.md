# Flight_Price_Prediction

This project aims to predict flight ticket prices based on historical flight data. By applying machine learning techniques, the project provides estimates for flight costs, enabling better informed travel planning.

Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing stage involves the following steps:
Converting date columns to datetime format.
Extracting day, month, and year information from the date of the journey.
Extracting departure and arrival hour and minute information.
Handling missing values and converting categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding.
